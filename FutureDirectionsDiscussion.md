# Introduction #

When Run Jetty Run was created, the goal was to create a very simple launcher for web apps, such that very little effort is required to launch an app for the first time, and such that the maintenance effort for the plug-in is similarly low.

The [Issues list](http://code.google.com/p/run-jetty-run/issues/list) contains many requests for new features, which I fear take it away from that goal.
Note also that with Jetty moving under the Eclipse umbrella, they can be expected to
provide more elaborate or complete launching support, which I think would argue for keeping Run Jetty Run simple.

None the less, we should discuss how to make this trade-off.  I invite folks to discuss how we can balance features, ease of use and ease of maintenance.  For example, we could make the plug-in extensible so that additional features can be added without changing the basic plug-in.
